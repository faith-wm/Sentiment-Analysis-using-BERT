# Sentiment Analysis using BERT

A project on sentiment analysis of tweets using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. Leveraging BERT's advanced NLP capabilities, the aim is to accurately classify tweets into three sentiment categories: Negative, Neutral, and Positive.

## Features
- Contextual Understanding: Utilizes BERT to comprehend the context within tweets.
- Sentiment Classification: Capable of categorizing tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- Transformer Application: Demonstrates the practical use of transformer models in sentiment analysis.

## Workflow
- Data Preparation: Dataset of tweets is prepared for model input.
- Model Training: BERT model is trained using the dataset.
- Sentiment Prediction: The trained model predicts and classifies tweet sentiments.
- Evaluation: Includes a classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) and Confusion Matrix for model performance assessment.
